We know not who we may meet on the way,  
or when those with us are lost astray.

Enjoy the company, while it lasts.  
Change comes quickly, it'll soon be past.

May your travels be interesting, memorable, and fabulous.  
May your compatriots be fun and sparkling, not onerous.

At the end of the road be sure to look back  
and cherish the friends you've made, not the gold in your sack.
