title: On Friendship
---

The freedom to say  
what's on your mind  
without filter or favor  
is the epitome of true friendship.

It is when you are able to be  
your most honest self,  
with ease and with glee.

Spending time with friends  
makes you feel lighter.  
It eases the burden  
and propels the jubilation.

So many things are easier with friends.  
I have friends who really listen to what I say,  
and I love them for it.  
And I have friends who don't really listen at all,  
and I love them for that too.

It is good to be deep,  
and wonderful to be glib. 
The interplay of ideas,  
the banter of buddies,  
the tandem of tone transcends  
mere conversational exchange  
and realizes the ever elusive state  
of social comfort:  
where no one is awkward,  
no one is pretending,  
no one is sacrificing for the sake of the other,  
where two people in service to themselves  
are perfectly servicing each other,  
where the vibe is sweet,  
and safe,  
and good.

It is good to have friends.  
And it is lucky to have friends.
