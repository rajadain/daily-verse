Red is my favorite color.  
It is, don't ask me why.  
Not violet, gold or silver,  
nor indigo or lilac shy.

Yellow is too happy,  
A simple solid smile.  
Blue is sombre sadness  
stretching for quite a while.

Black too strong, white too weak,  
green too livid, brown too bleak.  
Pink is pretentious, purple confused,  
orange is ugly and often abused.

I'm thankful for these rods  
and cones in my eyes.  
They make life a joy,  
the world a surprise.

Even when the edges blur  
and make it hard to see,  
the colors are always there  
for you and for me.
