title: Perfection
---

Everybody has an obsession:  
perfection is simply mine.  
At the limit of imagination  
flawlessness quietly shines.

An imperative rule to follow,  
impossible to escape or deny.  
Inside I feel empty and hollow,  
restless, anxious, and awry.

Powerless against the desire  
to want better, to want more.  
More heat than in a forest fire,  
more water than Western shores.

Chasing an unattainable dream  
to ends of the very Earth  
only to simmer and sear and scream  
at the futility of birth.

I will never be perfect to me,  
nor anything else, in fact.  
An improvement is often likely,  
depending on how I react.

The only consolation there is  
in this pointless exercise  
is producing something imperfect  
in front of my very eyes.
