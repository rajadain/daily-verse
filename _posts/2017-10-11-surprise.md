title: Surprise
---

In every facet of your body,  
from hips to lips to eyes  
lies the tingling sensation  
of effervescent surprise.

I'd capture some if only  
I had photographic memory.  
No pen or paint can muster  
more than a feeble reverie.

My wildest fantasies exceeded,  
my imagination put to shame  
by your wit, your grit, your will  
in this very moment that you came.
