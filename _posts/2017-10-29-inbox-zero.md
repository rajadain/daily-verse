title: Inbox Zero
---

There are a handful of emails  
lingering in my gmail  
preventing me from achieving  
the coveted inbox zero.

A pleasantry never returned,  
a logistic ungoverned,  
a reminder to update the website  
of a man whose wife's a widow.

These threads remain,  
refusing to unchain  
their present from my past,  
my past from their presence.

I can't bring myself to hit archive,  
face the truth and accept that I've  
failed those who reached out for help  
in my lazy incoherence.

As long as those emails remain  
in my mind the myth sustains  
that one day I'll respond to them  
and set things right, once again.
