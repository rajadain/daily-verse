title: Clumsy Dancer
---

I thought you knew how to dance,  
that you had dabbled in romance.

But you pulled on my skirt and stepped on my toe.  
Your moves are clumsy, your intention shallow.

I did not enjoy this dance, and got nothing out of it.  
Perhaps it taught you something, and you'll be a better fit.

But I'm cutting my losses and moving on  
to dance with a better partner to a better song.
