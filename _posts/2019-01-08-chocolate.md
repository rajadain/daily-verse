title: Chocolate
---

Naturally bitter,  
artificially sweet.  
A warm, welcoming,  
intoxicating treat.

Mysteriously dark, yet  
familiar and friendly.  
Liquid and solid,  
gooey and deadly.

An indulgence for the happy,  
a consolation for the sad.  
An accelerant of passion;  
aphrodisiac for the mad.

A pleasure without guilt,  
a substance without abuse.  
No, I'm not addicted.  
Yes, I'll have that mousse.
