title: Paragon

The first thing I noticed was the hair,  
then the jacket, the gait, the confident stare.

The piercing paragon of perfection impaled  
by a single solitary blemish unveiled.

Not divinity, no, but a regular woman.  
Perhaps that's the most we get as humans.

If not worship, maybe we get to love,  
to have and hold and be happy thereof.
