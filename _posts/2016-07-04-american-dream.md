title: American Dream
---

Amongst the best in this country,  
and the worst in the world,  
the American Dream is alive.

Between those walling up borders,  
and those escaping demagogues,  
the American Dream is alive.

Around those pronouncing judgment,  
and judgment-free zone seekers,  
the American Dream is alive.

In the minds of boomers losing savings,  
and millennials who may never have any,  
the American Dream is alive.

Amidst the slumber of the ignorant,  
and the stupor of the intoxicated,  
the American Dream is alive.

In a time of despair, in broken disrepair,  
against all odds, even when they know it's not there,  
they still pursue happiness, love, hope, and care,  
because Americans are dreamers, and quitters are rare.  

Despite all their differences, this one thing they share.  
The American Dream is alive.
