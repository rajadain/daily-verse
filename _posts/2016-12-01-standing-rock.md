They came with trucks  
and machines and guns  
to pipe their liquid gold.

The water and hills  
and all life therein  
to the highest bidder sold.

Politicians and newsmen  
look the other way,  
afraid to break the mold

while men and women are  
gassed and sprayed  
with water freezing cold.

On hearts and minds  
this struggle maintains  
an unyielding, striking hold.

Our times and values  
will be judged by this:  
by this our history told.

Of those who protected  
water, and those  
who would rather fold.

Of a world lush for  
the young, or trapped in  
the greed of the old.
