Your long slender fingers  
come and intertwine,  
as your lips approach  
and interlock with mine.

I cannot feel you  
without also being felt.  
The soft strokes soothing,  
the warmth that makes me melt.

The hum of your sweet voice  
resonates within my chest.  
Who knew that being this close  
would help me open best.
