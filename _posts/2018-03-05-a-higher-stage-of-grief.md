title: A Higher Stage of Grief
---

I refused it, denied it,  
absolutely decried it,  
this could never happen to me.

How dare he? The nerve!  
I hope he gets what he deserves:  
an evil witch as ugly as can be.

Is it true that we are done?  
No way this can be spun  
into a happy ending where he is mine?

My world is ashen and bleak.  
I no longer eat or sleep or speak.  
I just cry and weep and sob and bawl and pine.

These are the pieces of my life now.  
Well, almost all of them, anyhow.  
Slowly I will build myself up again.

Having been there, and done that,  
having on my face fell flat,  
I do think that I've learned a lot from pain.

But there's no way this was my fault,  
I am innocent by default.  
One day he's gonna pay for what he's done.

If only he'd given us a chance,  
my life would still have true romance,  
we'd be two instead of far and lonely ones.
