A forgotten piece from a lost past  
decimated a lifetime ago,  
suddenly encountered triggers a blast  
of memories of joy and sorrow.

The family gone, the friends never made,  
a whole world of potential denied.  
The blissful oblivious cavalcade  
of my reality tossed aside.

Tortured by ghosts of what could have been,  
severed from the needs of the present.  
Pain felt only by eyes that have seen,  
yet innocent, immature, nascent.

Every thing that reminds me of then  
must gradually be discarded.  
Those times are not easily forgotten  
but I will not be caught unguarded.

You were my home once, but now you're poison:  
the one thing that can counter my might.  
What was once nourishing is now noisome.  
I now know you are my Kryptonite.
