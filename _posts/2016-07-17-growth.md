If I am kind today, it is because  
I have seen what cruelty can do.  
Though I am charming today,  
I was once repulsive in my youth.

I am alive today for I was deemed  
worth sparing by a higher soul.  
I am a man today because someone saw  
gentleness within that ghoul.

I have hope today since I saw it once  
in the eyes of she who had nothing.  
I forgive you today because I was you,  
and I know how you are hurting.

The world is quick to judge, to vilify,  
to hate and lynch like a mob.  
Nurturing is much harder though,  
and often a two-man job.

You have my wrath, I can see  
my own anger burning in your eyes.  
But you also have my loving warmth,  
and wisdom beyond the skies.

Do not be discouraged if you do not like  
how you find yourself today.  
Know that you will in time become  
a greater man than me one day.
