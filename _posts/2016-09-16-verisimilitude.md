title: Verisimilitude

I remember exhaling my last breath  
as time started to slow around me.  
Sounds dimmed leaving a sharp whistle,  
vision narrowed to a single bright light,  
and my limbs became dull and heavy.

Empathy was the next to leave,  
as I stopped caring for anything else.  
Awareness of the world would soon follow,  
making me lethargic and disinterested in  
what others thought or did or felt.

The boredom and disconnectedness were too much,  
but it was too late to do anything about it.  
My bed had been made, my own wish granted,  
and now I had an eternity to marvel over  
the similarities between death and immortality.
