I seek beauty in form, flavor, and feeling.  
Bellydance and French Toast and wet pottery wheeling.

A daily dose of beauty quenches thirst like water.  
And it must be beautiful, not just cooler or hotter.

If you're not adding beauty, why are you even here?  
There's ugliness enough already, I'd rather steer clear.

I may never find happiness or relief from this pain,  
but in the end if I find beauty I'll be right as rain.
