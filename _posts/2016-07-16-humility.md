title: Humility
---

I am humble, I am small.  
I slouch so I'm not so tall.

I am kind, considerate, and I care.  
To none ill will shall I bear.

When the cards are counted and the tally complete,  
no one would be found more humble than me.

For I have sacrificed and suffered and slogged,  
the world is my inheritance, my glory to hog.
