I don't remember your eyes or lips,  
the sound of your voice long gone.  
No memory of the smile or fingertips  
that served happiness at Marathon.

All I have left is a warm fuzzy feeling  
every time I walk through those doors:  
of warmth and life and safety and healing,  
of home across distant shores.
