An entire lifetime captured in a breath:  
from supine to standing, from birth till death.

As I move forward from pose to pose  
I feel the flow of water, the tangling of rose.

Momentarily my focus wavers,  
pulling me to the present.  
Then I'm back, and all time is one,  
from sun to waning crescent.

Everyday struggles will soon be conquered:  
they cause me no more pain.  
Just like cat and cow, serpent and crow,  
crocodile, monkey, and crane.
