I'll mute you on Twitter,  
block you on Facebook,  
shut you out of my feed  
so I never have to look

at your suffering or pain  
or logic or perspective.  
Your truth is a lie and  
your sources vindictive,

they hate my ilk and  
despise my kind:  
if you let them  
they will poison your mind.

So share your damn articles,  
retweet to heart's delight.  
Make all the noise in the world,  
you've already lost the fight.

I see you shouting but all I hear  
is the comical sad trombone.  
My world doesn't care what you say  
in your tiny little free speech zone.
