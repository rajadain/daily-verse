To live a life of truth one must  
make good friends and earn their trust,  
care and help and love and heal  
and fill one's heart with zest and zeal.

Find the thing that's right to do,  
make a plan and follow through.  
Do not balk at those in need:  
help the fallen to their feet.

Focus on the task at hand.  
Be a man and take the stand.  
Do not lust for fame or fans â€”  
the myth comes later, first the man.
