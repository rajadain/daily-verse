title: Healing Touch
---

A healing touch is what I need.  
A caring glance, an honest deed.  
Your brilliance is without compare,  
but a brightness of the coldest breed.

As a moth to a fire, I was drawn  
to the magic of your dance and song.  
Expecting to get burned, instead I found
a cold, quiet, indifferent jawn.

Bitten by frost, shriveled in a shell,  
afraid to peek, or seek, or quell  
the fear of never finding love,  
giving up and settling in this hell.

But a healing touch could make me whole,  
put me back in a husband's role.  
Though I may never love like that again,  
I'll love and live like man, not mole.
