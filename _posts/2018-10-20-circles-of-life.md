title: Circles of Life
---

Living every day, one day at a time,  
we rarely see the curve, the shape, the line  
that life tends to make, veering this way and that,  
sometimes two steps forward, sometimes three steps back.

How deep are the grooves that guide our wheels  
in ways we never notice, forces we never feel,  
locking us in its grip of subtle predestination,  
subject to health, wealth, chance, and situation?

An intervention is needed to break the chains that bind,  
to heal the body, raise the spirit, comfort the heart, and free the mind.  
Let's not make the same mistakes over and over again.  
Go someplace new, try something different, see what happens then.
