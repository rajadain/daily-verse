How long I've waited for you to come  
my equal, able, worthy foe.  
How long I've wished to unleash myself  
and see how far can I go.

You let me be my full, true self:  
my every fiber working as one.  
Not so with friends and allies with whom  
compromises must be done.

I won't hold back, not anymore,  
for you can take a beating.  
And with you, in loss there's equal joy  
as there is in defeating.
