title: Last Days
---

If all I had was a year to live,  
I'd travel the world, a heart adrift.

When only a handful months remain,  
I'll code and write, sketch and paint.

I'll feast in my final fortnight  
on favorite foods and sweet delights.

I'll save a few concluding days  
for admiring nature's wonderous ways.

And in my last remaining hour or two,  
I'll sit back, relax, and think of you.
