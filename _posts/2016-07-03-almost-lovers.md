title: Almost Lovers
---

Almost lovers make the best of friends:  
they care for each other truly.  
By not crossing that invisible line  
love never spills over to the unruly.

They always forgive and always forget  
for the promise of a maybe future.  
Even though in their hearts they know  
that he's not her real suitor.
