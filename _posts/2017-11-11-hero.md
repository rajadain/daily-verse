I'm not the hero you're looking for,  
I'm not the man you think.  
I've lied and hurt and cheated and stole.  
I smoke, I toke, I drink.

With power and fame and money and game  
comes each and every vice.  
My art was never artless:  
but brimming with artifice.

The rules are different for guys like me,  
at least that's what they said.  
And I believed them, and pretty soon  
the power went to my head.

"Come here," "stand there", "a mocha chai latte!"  
I'd scream at servants many.  
"Good help is so hard to find," I'd say,  
"there really isn't any."

I'd push and I'd crush and move on to  
the next project without a break,  
never noticing the devastation I was  
leaving in my wake.

The broken hearts, the crippled careers,  
the extent of innocence lost:  
the weight of all my sins combined,  
the price of fame, the cost.

I never asked to be a hero,  
but I've enjoyed it I'll admit.  
The higher up you raised me  
the further I fall to shit.

I've taken a hit, but I'll recover  
and return in a renaissance.  
But what of those whom I've abused,  
who may never sing or dance?

Remember me for my art,  
my single noblest part.  
Do not peek behind the stage:  
it'll only break your heart.

Learn from my life, exceed it  
in every way you can.  
Dream and lead and succeed,  
be an example to every man.

The time has come for you to  
choose your heroes anew.  
The time has come for me to leave  
and I bid you adieu.
