title: Superiority
---

I'm better than everyone I know.  
Everyone knows, I told them so.

I'm righter, truer, braver, brighter.  
Of stupidity I'm a tireless fighter.

I will teach you, beseech you, to see the light I see.  
And if you don't then you're a fool and so will always be.

I cannot allow a moment of doubt,  
of considering what if I fall.  
My arrogant ruse is nothing more,  
and really I'm quite small.
