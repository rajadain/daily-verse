title: Idle Animation

Have you ever put, for the second time, shampoo in your hair  
because you're standing in the shower, and that's what you do there?

How many times have you swiped left and swiped right  
as your eyes glazed over, thoughts drifting to the night?

Do you take out your phone to check the time or the weather  
only to become lost in Instagram or Twitter?

These idle animations of when the mind checks out  
reflect our conditioning to technological clout.

My behavior in these little gaps in between  
give me away as a man from twenty seventeen.
