title: Anger
---

I've held it in, as long as I could,  
thinking that if I can I should,  
even as I burned with rage  
trapped within my mental cage.

I've let it out, without thought or care,  
on strangers and loved ones: whoever was there  
to witness a grown man melting down,  
his twisted mouth making tortured sounds.

I've let it in, let it consume my being,  
anyone who disagrees a filthy philistine,  
until I shut absolutely everyone out,  
my hate unwavering, no room for doubt.

I've let it go, knowing there's nothing to be said.  
Any hope of reconciliation is long gone and dead.  
I feel no more anger, no hatred or disdain.  
I now feel only numbness to both pleasure and pain.
