title: Accidental Saint
---

After years of wandering in the woods  
I came up with this brilliant plan.  
A foolproof logic that consistently would  
stand up to the most inquisitive man.

The true nature of things is unknowable  
and my life had indeed been wasted.  
So I devised something showable  
with lies within it nested.

A slight untruth that would protect  
a saintly, wise recluse.  
As long as one doesn't deeply inspect  
it's certainly not abuse.

I lie for myself, to justify  
a miserable, failed persistence.  
I lie knowing it doesn't signify  
anything beyond my own existence.

My words won't stand the test of time:  
before long their faults discovered.  
Then someone new may begin to mine  
the depths of Truth left uncovered.

The most tragic outcome I can think  
is of my words enduring long.  
Of people trusting an old dry ink  
and a convoluted, meaningless song.

But the chances of that are slim and low  
for the future's always smarter.  
The coming generations of tomorrow  
must go far, and even farther.

So I think I'm safe with my little lie  
though my profession it will taint.  
The world won't devolve and have to survive  
on the tales of an accidental saint.
