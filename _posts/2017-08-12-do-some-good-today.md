title: Do Some Good Today
---

There's a mantra I can tell you:  
do some good today.

The world can be a tough, bitter place:  
divided by hate, united in fear.  
Do not lose hope, do not give up.  
Hard times bring out the best in some.

Look for the generous, the benevolent, the kind,  
they're there, right in front of you.  
For every man filled with rage, there are a dozen  
full of humor, and courage, and love.

If you raise your voice,  
use it for peace and unity.  
If you raise your hand,  
use it to help and heal.

The good outnumber the bad.  
Always have, always will.  
Doing bad is easy, doing good is better.  
A little good can go a long way.

Before every action, ask yourself:  
will this hurt or will this heal?  
Will it benefit or will it bereave?  
Whom does it help, who pays the price?

Your good is only a drop in the ocean,  
but good news: the oceans are rising.  
In the face of hate, of rage, of nature:  
say no. Refuse to participate.

Only do good. Do the most good you can.  
Do whatever little good you can manage.  
There is enough fire and fury already.  
We do not need to make matters worse.

Will you not join me,  
and do some good today?
