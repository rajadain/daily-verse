title: Ball & Chain
---

Your playful voice lifts me up,  
your welcome tweets make me smile.  
Your presence is smooth,  
pleasant, and soothes  
and I almost forget for a while...

I know you don't owe me anything,  
and I'd never take your pity.  
Yet, I wonder if what ails me,  
binds and derails me,  
is beyond your capacity.

It is I who am truly sorry  
for being unable to soar.  
Even as my heart wishes to fly  
with you into the sky,  
my mind is tethered to the floor.

Will I ever be free of these chains,  
these sins that drag me down?  
Am I never to take wing again?  
Hear the wind sing again?  
Just scamper on the ground?

I may never find another as you,  
of that I'm acutely aware.  
But if there's one thing I can do,  
it's not letting it drag you too:  
it is my burden to bear.

I'm too well anchored to hope  
to achieve escape velocity.  
Until I find a way to break free,  
or learn to somehow carry it with me,  
the ball and chain is my reality.
