title: Eleventh Year
---

I leave for new lands,  
new hopes, new friends!  
I leave in search of excitement  
and adventure that never ends.

Having lived and loved  
in this city of mine,  
I've grown so much,  
but it's finally time.

My eleventh year ends soon,  
and with it I too shall go  
to the mountains of rock and honey dew  
with lush green valleys below.

Westward and upward,  
as the Sun I too shall rise.  
This place has been like life to me  
but it will not be my demise.
