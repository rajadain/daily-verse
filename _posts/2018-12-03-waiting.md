title: Waiting

I'm waiting at the airport  
for you to arrive.

As each passenger exits,  
I look into their face.  
A quick jaunt  
from hope to doubt,  
from recognition  
to the lack thereof,  
to disappointment,  
to worry.

All in the briefest of moments.

We who wait look to each other,  
never saying a word  
but silently nodding inside  
with a shared appreciation  
of this fleeting pathos.

I know you're coming,  
and as soon as you arrive  
life kicks into gear,  
conversing and commuting.

But until then, I'm waiting.
