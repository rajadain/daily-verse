They said you weren't coming,  
I was told not to wait:  
and make a reservation  
before it is too late.

I really want to talk,  
there is so much to say.  
But my calendar's all booked  
for the rest of the day.

If only I'd kept me free,  
we'd be together tonight.  
But instead you're now leaving  
by an early morning flight.

When will I be able  
to see you like this again?  
I won't be me, you won't be you,  
it won't be now, then.
