They let me paint, so I painted.  
They told me to write, so I wrote.  
They taught me patience, so I waited  
till they left, and painted this note.

They taught me to be  
the very best I can be  
but my best might not be enough.

Without you I just wander  
and ponder and wonder  
how a life so fine feels so rough.
