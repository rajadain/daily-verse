If I could have any ability,  
it wouldn't be speed or flying.  
What I wish I was able to do  
is ably comfort the dying.

To soothe their pain  
and remedy their guilt.  
To remind them of  
the lives they built.

To help reflect on what was,  
and ponder what lies ahead:  
for those who go on living,  
and those who will be dead.

To witness life about them,  
in its glorious impermanence,  
vibrant diversity, grave sincerity,  
and steady, graceful cadence.

It is an honor to have lived  
with such feeling and integrity.  
The body may be frail,  
but not without its dignity.

Of all the people you have met,  
I will be the last.  
The pain is coming to an end,  
soon it'll all be past.

You've conquered the mysteries of life,  
but mysteries of death await.  
Go in peace, go with love, go with courage  
onwards through Heaven's gate.
