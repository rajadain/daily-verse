title: Forever
---

A lifetime is forever,  
the longest time you'll see.  
From birth till death, a journey long,  
everything you'll ever be.

You can't promise beyond your power,  
at death it comes to end.  
The lives of those around you  
only the living can influence.

Forever is not an unfair term,  
it reaches from aught to nought.  
Limited only to s/he who says it,  
constrained only by thought.

I do what I can with what I have,  
and I will give you that in my power.  
A fact of life, plain as day:  
I'll love you for forever.
