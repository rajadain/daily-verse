title: Protection
---

I protected you from poverty,  
from the inadequacies of life.

I protected you from loneliness,  
my love ever at your side.

I protected you from boredom,  
an adventure always planned.

I protected you from danger,  
your presence never unmanned.

In a moment of vulnerability,  
of pain and anger and fear,

I struck you in my rage,  
blinding and severe.

A lifetime of protection, in a moment lost:  
dismissed, brushed aside.

I couldn't protect you from myself,  
and for that I'll be crucified.
