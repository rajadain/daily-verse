title: The Man That You Deserve
---

It's not just you that I miss,  
though I miss you so,  
more than you'll ever know.

It's who I could have been  
had you let me stay,  
had you changed me in your way.

Like a collapsing wave  
killing futures in its wake,  
rippling the calmest of lakes,

That fake maybe self,  
a faint fantasy at best,  
shadows and echoes abreast.

The romantic mind,  
addled and wonting,  
impressed by ghosts and given to haunting,

Is tainted with your image,  
and the promises thereof:  
a me much finer than a me so rough.

One day I'll find happiness,  
and love too I suppose.  
A matter of time in a large enough dose.

What I may never find, however,  
for I clearly lack the nerve,  
is the man I could have been, the man that you deserve.
